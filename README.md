## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project is to utilize TI peripherals UART2, I2C, GPIO, etc. to establish a thermostat. Such thermostat should be able to generate output to the terminal console that expresses current temperature, set termperature, if the LED is on, and the current time. This project is designed to help us understand how different peripherals are working with each other.

## What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did particularly well was to understand the task scheduler and design necessary functions to carry out the critical tasks

## Where could you improve?
As shown in the video, my hardware component keeps returning error messages despite all the efforts to solve this issue. Therefore, I could improve on fixing this hardware and demonstrating a better result

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I have used TI CC3220S official documentation, techstacks, online forums, and helps from professor and colleagues as supports for my project.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I have learned a lot about C coding as well as how CCS uses C code to communicate with hardware component

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have added necessary comments to my code to stick with industry best practice. Instead of bulking up the main function, I have created functions with different functionalities to handle different tasks
